# CS534 ML Final Project: Seizure Detection Seizure Prediction
## Overview

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models for seizure detection and prediction using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Epilepsy, a neurological disorder, affects millions worldwide, and automated seizure detection systems are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study explores various machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify seizure events and predict the onset of seizures.

## Objectives

**Seizure Detection:** Classify EEG clips as either seizure (ictal) or non-seizure (interictal) using machine learning models.

**Seizure Prediction:** Predict the likelihood of an upcoming seizure by distinguishing between preictal and interictal EEG states.

## Dataset

**Source:** The data used in this project is sourced from the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic.

**Structure:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Seizure Detection:** EEG clips labeled as "Ictal" or "Interictal."   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Seizure Prediction:** EEG clips labeled as "Preictal" (before seizure) or "Interictal."
