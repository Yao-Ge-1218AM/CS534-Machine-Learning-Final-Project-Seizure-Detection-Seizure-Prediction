and hospital course   hospital course:  60 yo female with pmh of diabetes and hypothyroidism, admitted for exploratory laporotomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to an incidental finding of a pelvic mass on ct at an outside hospital.  the patient tolerated to procedure well, ebl was 500 ml.  see operative noted for details.  her post-operative course was complicated on post-operative day 1 by an acute episode of excessive drowsiness during which her oxygen saturation decreased to approximately 87% and she became tachycardic.  a ct pe protocol was ordered which was negative, as well as an ekg, cmp, cbc, tsh, cardiac enzymes, and accucheck.  findings were significant at that time for decreased tsh to 0.37 and a sodium level of 132.  she was given narcan and was started on normal saline.  her synthroid was held.  immediately after giving narcan, the patient became alert and oriented.  final results of the ct the following day revealed liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, possible esophageal varices, and pulmonary congestion concerning for hepatopulmonary syndrome.  hepatology was consulted and the patient had an intial work up with labs, mri, and echo with buble study.  she will continue her work up and evaluation with them as an outpatient.  her post-operative course was otherwise uncomplicated.  she met all of her post-operative goals including tolerating normal diet, ambulating, voiding, and passing flatus.  her hemoglobin upon discharge was 8.0.  she had no symptoms of anemia.   she was initially receiving heparin for post-operative prophylaxis, however this was discontinued upon her new diagnosis of cirrhosis.  her diabetes was controlled on sliding scale insulin.  her hypothyroidism was initially controlled on her home dose of synthroid, however when her tsh was found to be 0.37, this was discontinued.  additonally, secondary to her cirrhosis and splenomegaly, she had thrombocytopenia which was stable at 88k.  her pain was well controlled on tramadol.  she was discharged to home in stable condtion on post-operative day 4.  she will follow up with dr. khanna on 1/17 for staple removal and post-operative exam and she will

consult: service: social services.    problem and hospital course   hospital course:  presenting history: mr. jones is an 88 yo male with a pmh of chf, copd, severe dementia 2/2 tertiary syphillis, htn, hld, ckd, dvt?, gi bleed?, seizures?, schizophrenia?, and history of pacemaker, who presents from nursing home with dyspnea and hypoxia.  history is significantly limited as patient is non-verbal and drowsy and has no accompanying family, and few  medical records on transfer.  per nursing home, he was short of breath last night, and was given a neb.  his o2 sat was in the 60\\'s.  he was placed on non-rebreather which brought his sat into the 80\\'s, and he was transferred here.  in the ed he was given duonebs and 60 of iv lasix, and his o2 saturation improved, to where he is now near 100% on 5 l.  patient nods his head to feeling short of breath.  he also nods yes to chest pain, abdominal pain, leg pain, although he does not appear to understand the questions.  he then falls back asleep.  pcp was called but unavailable.  nursing home to send more records, including his home meds.  daughter was called and she is aware of a recent hospitalization at south fulton for chf exacerbation, but is not familiar with what is going on right now.   hospital course by problem: acutely decompensated systolic and diastolic heart failure :  no records to establish etiology (systolic vs diastolic, ischemic vs non-ischemic).  was not on diuretic at home.  unclear trigger as likely was receiving meds at nursing home, without recent diet change.  non-verbal, and he did not understand our questions about chest pain.  no trop or ecg changes.  no arrhythmias on admission.  clearly volume overloaded on admission, his cxr showed pulmonary edema, and his bnp was elevated at 701.  cr 1.43 on admission, unclear baseline.  tte was done here and showed ef 40-45%, moderate diastolic dysfunction, moderate to severe mr, dilated ivc.  we gave iv diuresis thoughout his stay and he responded well.  at one point he did bump his creatinine slightly so we switched to po and his cr came back down.  however, on recheck his bnp actually went up and his cxr was worse, so we did another 3 days of iv diuresis, during which time his cr stayed stable.  we discharged him on 50 po torsemide every other day for better gut absorption, and continued his anti-hypertensives as below. dementia:   appears end-stage.  he was non-verbal and non-mobile on admission.  he did begin to move his upper extremities and feed himself towards the end of his stay, but could not communicate or follow commands.  we discussed this with his daughter in-depth, but it does not appear she understands the severity of his illness.  unfortunately, she never came by the hospital to see him.  we did stop his aricept and namenda as he is already end-stage and these would not be helpful anymore.  we did a ct head just to rule out acute stroke as daughter reported his being better than we observed, but this only showed some age-indeterminate lacunar infarct.  we did continue his asa but did not start a statin as we did not want to risk myalgias in this patient who cannot communicate.  the patient remained full code per daughter\\'s request.  palliative care was consulted and talked about prognosis with his daughter.  wound care was also consulted for his le wounds, and speech for his diet. copd:   short of breath with mild leukocytosis on admission.  however, no fever and no cough, with another explanation for his dyspnea (chf).  did not appear likely for copd exacerbation, and we did not treat that way.  leukocytosis resolved on its own.  we gave duonebs prn and held his pulmicort as he could not participate with inhalers. chronic kidney disease:   unknown baseline cr.  cr 1.4 on admission and overall remained stable. anemia:  hgb 8.8 on admission.  unknown baseline.  did apparently have a gi bleed within the past month or so.  his h/h was stable during his stay, appeared to be iron deficiency.  work up as outpatient if desired, pt not actively bleeding, on iron replacement hypertension:  on norvasc 10, coreg 25 bid.  well controlled on admission.  we continued these. hyperlipidemia:   per history.  not on lipid-lowering therapy.  we did not do statin for prophylaxis with the possibility of myalgias in patient who can\\'t communicate this.   coronary artery disease:   stable.  no trop elevation or ecg changes (though he is v-paced, he did not have sgarbossa criteria).  we continued asa 81, bb seizures:   continued keppra 500 bid schizophrenia:   continued risperdal 0.5 qam, 1.25 qhs diabetes mellitus:   continued home ssi, poct h/o dvt:  unknown when this dvt was or where.  he is not on coumadin, probably because this was > 6 months ago or because of his recent gi bleed at south fulton. - no coumadin leukocytosis, resolved:   wbc 10.5 on admission.  likely 2/2 stress.  no signs of infection on cxr or ua, no infected looking wounds.

limited                views.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- final echocardiographic findings: summary/conclusions:  1. left ventricular ejection fraction is 35%. systolic function is best visualized in the contrast-enhanced images (frames 66-81).  2. 1: multiple segmental abnormalities exist. see findings. these correlate with a prior lad-territory infarction.  3. mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness.  4. mild diastolic dysfunction with an impaired relaxation pattern and normal left atrial pressure.  5. mildly dilated left atrium.  6. no pericardial effusion noted. heart rhythm: ekg showed normal sinus rhythm. the average heart rate was approximately 64 beats per minute. left ventricle: optison echo contrast was given iv to enhance endocardial definition. the left ventricular size is normal and measures 4.72 cm. left ventricular wall thickness is mildly increased. lv ejection fraction is 35%. mild diastolic dysfunction with an impaired relaxation pattern and normal left atrial pressure. lv wall scoring: the apical septal segment, apical anterior segment, apical inferior segment, and apex are akinetic. the mid anteroseptal segment, mid inferoseptal segment, and apical lateral segment are hypokinetic. left atrium: left atrial cavity size is mildly dilated. the left atrial a/p dimension is 3.18 cm. la volume index is 29 ml/m2. right ventricle: the right ventricle was not well visualized. global right ventricular systolic function is probably normal. right atrium: the right atrium is normal in size. mitral valve: the mitral valve is normal in structure, with normal leaflet excursion. there is no mitral stenosis or regurgitation. aortic valve: the aortic valve is trileaflet and structurally normal, with normal leaflet excursion without any evidence of aortic stenosis or insufficiency. tricuspid valve: trace tricuspid regurgitation is detected. pulmonic valve: there is trace pulmonic valve insufficiency. thoracic aorta: the aortic root at the annulus is not well visualized. the aortic root size at the level of the sinuses of valsalva is not well visualized. the sinotubular junction is not well visualized. the transverse aorta is of normal size. pulmonary veins: the pulmonary veins were not assessed in this study. ivc/hepatic veins: the inferior vena cava is normal.

case.    procedure  summary  indications: nstemi procedures: 1. left heart diagnostic catheterization 2. ventriculogram 3. aortic valve pullback findings: access was obtained via the r femoral artery with a 6 french shealth. a jl4 was used to canulate the left coronary artery.  this demonstrated the previously known subtotal occulsion of the lad just proximal to d2 within a prior stent.  he also had 50% in-stent stenosis within his proximal lad stent.  the distal lad was filled by rentrop ii collateral flow from the cirx/om.  the cirx/om was free of disease. a jr4 was used to canulate the right coronary artery.  this vesel was free of disease. the jr catheter was then used to engage the lima bypass.  this  demonstrated a patent lima to a small d2 branch. recommendations: 1. continue medical therapy for anti-anginal and cad risk factor modication. 2. consider anticoagulation or asa/plavix for apical anuerysm and potential for clot formation..   .    problem and hospital course

for 29 mm transcatheter valve implantation cohort b, as part of 29 mm partner nested registry. list:. severe aortic stenosis, trileaflet calcific aortic valve.  the patient was    initially enrolled in the partner 1 trial cohort b, but unfortunately on    table was found to have an annulus too large to fit a 26 mm valve and hence    had to be postponed, that was in 2007.  he was admitted this time for 29 mm    transcatheter aortic valve implantation as part of the partner 29 mm valve    registry.  procedure was done in the operating room by a transfemoral    percutaneous approach from the left common femoral artery.  the initial    delivery system had to be aborted due to a technical malfunction of the    delivery device.  postoperative day 4, he developed a 5 x 5 cm left common

partner 1 cohort b patient, who could not be implanted when it was realized on table that his was too large to fit the largest available valve size at that time, was a 26 mm edwards sapien valve.  his procedure had to be postponed, and the interim, he has been ballooned with a balloon aortic valvuloplasty 3.  he was electively admitted to the hospital this time to be implanted a 29 mm edwards sapien xt valve as part of a nested registry for this new.  he underwent high-risk aortic stenosis workup including a left heart, lower extremity angiography, transthoracic echocardiogram, ct scan chest,, pelvis without contrast and pfts.  the patient underwent the procedure 11/28/2012.  it was performed in the operating room due to this being a patient with a new valve, otherwise, there were no other high risk.  he had an excellent result.  of note, his initial delivery system needed to be removed.  luckily, the valve could also be removed the new e-sheath system.  a 2nd device, an introduction delivery system then introduced and the valve was implanted successfully.  post procedure, patient had only trace perivalvular regurgitation.  overall, he did well a symptomatic standpoint with improvement in his functional capacity. __________, there was note of a left atrial appendage thrombus, likely occurred because the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, was off coumadin in the days before his procedure to reduce bleeding risk. patient was started on a heparin drip once arteriotomy and venotomy site was achieved post procedure.  unfortunately, post procedure day 4, patient developed a 5 x 5 cm left femoral artery hematoma.  an ultrasound not show any evidence of pseudoaneurysm or other abnormalities.  coumadin continued and the patient was

diabetes, hypertension, s/p coronary artery bypass graft, hypothyrodism, seizure disorder, anemia of chronic disease, depression, dementia, and peptic ulcer disease that was initially admitted to spaulding medical center where he was intubated for respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia.  the pneumonia was complicated with a left parapneumonic effusion and empyema.  the patient was also diagnosed with h. flu bacteremia which was being treated with ceftriaxone and linezolid.   the patient was transferred to euhm on december 9, 2012 for further management and evaluation. chest ct on december 10 revealed a crescentic fluid collection with adjacent pleural thickening at the left lung base likely representing empyema, ards vs multifocal pneumonia, and small layering right pleural effusion.  on december 17, dr. allan pickens performed a vats with left thoracoscopic decortications. no complications were noted and a left chest tube remains in place. he required prolonged ventilator support.  dr. pickens and dr. david berkowitz performed a tracheostomy with bronchoscopy on december 22.   the patient has had multiple postoperative complications throughout his hospitalization.  this includes multiple infections requiring antibiotics, massive subcutaneous emphysema which resolved with tracheostomy placement, septic shock requiring vasopressors, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and arterial hemorrhage status post right vas cath removal that required emergent surgical repair by dr. jay miller on december 31.  the patient is currently hemodynamically stable tolerating minimal ventilator support.   neuro :   the patient is arousable and responds to his name and following commands.  upon awakening, the patient becomes tachypneic and agitated.  his agitation is improving with the use of a fentanyl patch, zyprexa, and prn iv fentanyl and ativan.  unable to use haldol or seroquel due to prolonged qt. cv : the patient is currently hemodynamically stable and off vasopressors.  pulm :  the patient requires prolonged ventilator support status post vats decortication.  he received a #8 cuffed trach on december 22.  the patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings and is on slow ventilator wean.  he has had high minute ventilation =13-15.  he is tolerating ps 10/5 without difficulty.  his minute ventilation increases up to 21 with severe agitation. massive subcutaneous emphysema resolved after the trach was placed. he still has a left surgical chest tube with persistent/intermittent air leak on water seal.  there has been no fluid drainage for the past week.  thoracic surgery wants to keep the chest tube in place until the air leak has resolved and after the patient is off the ventilator. renal :  the patient developed acute renal failure and is dialysis dependent.  dialysis is managed by dr. frita fisher.  the patient had his femoral vas-cath removed on december 31.  unfortunately, he had severe hemorrhage from the femoral artery which required emergent repair by dr. jay miller.  a left subclavian permacath was placed.   gi :  on 1-7-13, the patient removed his dobhoff and is now tolerating tube feeds via oral

  reaching highs of 210 systolic and 110 diastolic.  the patient was    normalized on medication regimen as below in discharge medications.    hydralazine was used for afterload reduction rather than lisinopril once    the patient had acute kidney injury.. hypothyroidism.  not an issue during hospitalization.. chronic back and leg pain.  the patient had inconsistent exams related to    localization of pain between acute pain service, primary team and nursing    staff.  acute pain decided that lortab would be a good option for the    patient, but they felt that the patient\\'s mental

symptoms and heart disease could be explained by progression of her aortic    stenosis.  the patient\\'s shortness of breath was resolved for most of the    hospitalization after the 80 of lasix she got at an outside facility.    however, she did require careful volume management and decompensated    quickly when she was diuresed following a blood transfusion.  patient was    discharged on an appropriate regimen for someone with heart failure and was    given lasix to take p.r.n.  patient will need to have careful volume    management from this point forward.. anemia.  patient left the hospital 1 week prior to this admission with a    hemoglobin of 10.  throughout this admission, the hemoglobin lowered slowly    but steadily to 7.2.  patient was given a transfusion.  ct of the abdomen    showed a small hematoma in the left inguinal region which probably does not    explain all 3 g of her blood loss.  the dopplers of her femoral arteries at    the site of access for her recent balloon aortic valvuloplasty were    negative for pseudo aneurysm, dissection, or hematoma.  patient responded    appropriately to 1 unit of packed red blood cells and had stable hemoglobin    for several days prior to discharge.. acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease.  patient has baseline    creatinine of 1.5.  creatinine rose as high as 2.4 while here but was lower    steadily and was 1.93 on discharge.  this was likely related to vascular    congestion from heart failure.. headache.  patient had a right-sided headache after receiving bidil during    this hospitalization.  the headache resolved when nitrates were    discontinued from her medication regimen.  tramadol and tylenol were used    to control her headaches were nitrates were felt to be essentially to    correcting her acute abnormalities in the hospital. medication list:          patient was discharged on the following:  pravastatin 40 mg, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg q.12 h., imdur 30 q. day, plavix

      seizures and altered mental status. diagnoses:. sepsis.. acute respiratory failure.. opioid dependence.. seizures. for admission:               the patient is a 56-year-old female with a of cvas x5 with residual paraplegia, colostomy, coronary artery, neurogenic bladder status post suprapubic catheter placement/04/2012, who came in with altered mental status for approximately 1-2 hours. was last seen normal at 5 a.m. on 12/20 by the nursing staff, and at 6 a.m. having seizure-like activity in the right arm.  she was feverish and to pain.  she does not have any history of seizures, however, she was depakote.  in the er she was noted to have a seizure with chronic motion of right upper extremity with delayed respirations.  the seizure lasted 3 minutes, subsided spontaneously.  no other parts of the body involved.  while postictal, the patient was noted to have difficulty and tachycardic to the 120s with hypoxia to 88%.  the patient was in the ed for airway protection and returned with hyponatremia at.  she was given fluids.  she was started on vancomycin and zosyn.  blood drawn.  her creatinine was also elevated at 1.4.  neuro was consulted noted the patient to be in status epilepticus on eeg. course:. the patient was initially seen by neurology who, on eeg, saw status    epilepticus-like waveforms.  she was started on fosphenytoin and keppra.    no other suggestions besides treating the underlying disorder.  she had a    head ct on admission that showed left parietal occipital encephalomalacia,    likely related to a remote infarct.  a small area of patchy hypodensity in    right parietal region is likely in keeping with remote infarct.    microangiopathic changes.  no acute intracranial abnormality.. cardiology:  the patient came in with a complicated cardiac history of    coronary artery disease with aortic valve replacement.  her hypotension in    the beginning resolved with levophed and vasopressin, and those were able    to be removed.  she was placed on a lasix drip that has been titrated down    to a urine output of 50% to 70% ml/h for chf, to improve respiratory    function.  she had an echo done 12/26, that showed ejection fraction of 35%    with severely dilated left atrium, concern for takotsubo\\'s.  there was a    repeat echo done 12/31, with improvement and her ejection fraction was up    to 60%.  she had a moderate diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormal pattern    and evidence of elevated left atrial pressures.  also had mild to moderate    mitral valve regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation.  again, there    was moderately dilated left atrium.. respiratory:  she arrived in respiratory failure, was hypoxic and    tachypneic and intubated.  she was started on ac 400/20/fio2 of 70% with a    peep of 5 and a first blood gas of 7.44/27/243.  she was also started on    the ards net protocol and received steroids.  she continued throughout her    stay to have high plateau pressures.  x-rays demonstrated consolidation    with a haziness pattern.  on 01/04 she had a ct chest that demonstrated    worsening pneumonia type pictures versus ards.  there was also bilateral    pleural effusions that were increased on the right and the left was    unchanged.  she then had a pigtail placed on the right per ir that    originally drained 700 ml of fluid, and in the following 2 days 300 ml of    fluid.  over the next 12 hours she tolerated vent settings changing to apv    simv at 25/450/5 and 40% with plateau pressures in the low 20s.  she has    continued to fail sbts by getting tachycardic and tachypneic.. gastrointestinal:  no gi problems throughout stay.  she has a colostomy.    she is on tube feeds at her goal of 30 ml/h.. genitourinary:  the patient came in with acute kidney injury with a    creatinine baseline of 0.8 and she has ranged between 1.4 and 1.8.  injury    most likely prerenal with a sepsis picture.  sodium came up slowly from 118    on arrival to the normal range, and then after being on lasix drip, it    bumped up to the low 150s.  she was then given free water and it dropped    down to the low 140s.. endocrine:  she has a history of diabetes mellitus and was placed on    sliding scale.  there were no complications.. hem/onc:  she has a history of iron deficiency anemia with a current h and    h of 13/36 and 1 month was 8/24.  she most likely was hemoconcentrated on    arrival.  her hemoglobin hovered around 7 and on 01/06 she was transfused 1    unit of packed red blood cells to increase oxygen carrying capacity, and    she bumped up to 9.. infectious disease:  she started out with a white blood count of 30,000 and    was hypothermic, finishing antibiotic course of vancomycin and zosyn.  she    then continued to spike fevers throughout her stay and id was consulted.    chest x-ray continued to seem volume overloaded, but no __________ could    have hidden.  blood cultures have all been negative.  urine cultures showed    a small amount of yeast.  respiratory cultures from a bal 12/27    demonstrated 4+ candida.  a mini bal on 12/31 demonstrated less than 10,000    yeast and the bal on 01/04 had afb smear that was negative, no organism on    gram stain.  culture positive yeast without bacterial growth.  fluid showed    195 white blood cells with 72% pmn.  she also had a c. difficult that was    negative.  fever was still unknown origin and improved.  a ct maxillofacial    was performed that was negative for sinusitis.  fosphenytoin was stopped    01/03 and the fevers have improved.  this could have contributed.  gyn:    saw the patient with a labial ulcer that has improved and did grow out    pseudomonas.  she has finished a 7-day course of levaquin.  there was no    area to i and d.  she also had ultrasound demonstrating no dvts. patient is currently on the vent of apv simv at 25/450/5 and 40%, doing.  she has chronic pain as an ache in her entire body, and has an opioid.  she has been on a regimen of oxycodone 20 mg every 4 hours along fentanyl drip at 3 mcg/kg/h and p.r.n. dilaudid with an additional 50 mcg patch.  she was transitioned over to ms contin 60 mg b.i.d. and this led to better pain control.  palliative care has been involved with this\\'s course.  they do not have any specific recommendations. now that the is stable on the vent with her trach, and stable hemodynamically, she

dx was pna, and he developed acute resp failure. patient appeared volume overloaded. patient started on lasix gtt and diuril. with little output patient. patient became obtunded on the floor and was transferred to ccu for intubation. patient recieved central line. pressures began to decrease and he was started on levo initially and then vasopressin. as well as dobutamine for cardiogenic shock. diagnosed with pna and treated w/ broad spectrum abx. volume overload and acute on chronic renal failure treated with lasix drip diuresis. pressors eventually weaned and pt improved clinically.   extubation was attempted on 1/13, but pt developed increased co2 retention and acidosis. bipap therapy failed, and intubation attempted with significant difficulty. pt became acidotic w/ ph 7.1 and code was called for pea arrest.  he had a total of 4 mg of epinephrine, 1 mg atropine, 1 gm of calcium chloride, 1 gm of magnesium, an 1 amp of bicarb.  the patient then went into vfib and was shocked a total of 4-5 times by his aicd.  he was then given an amiodarone bolus 300 mg iv push and then started on an amiodarone gtt.  he eventaully resuscitated with afib with rvr.  the patients blood pressures increased back to normal and his blood flow of his lvad returned to normal as well.  the code lasted for about 10 minutes.   the patient did have episodes of hypoxia after failed attempts at intubation, he was bagged intermittently during the code.  following the code he had evidence of subcutaneous air on exam, cxr confirmed this finding, and he had a bronch showing a small tear in his oropharyngeal area/upper trachea.  during the code there was a significant amount of bright red bloody secretions from the op, there was also a large thick blood clot that was removed from the op. this is likely from a traumatic emergent re-intubation that resulted from his difficult airway. after the arrest and prolonged hypoxia because of difficult/traumatic intubation, he was maintained on antibiotics, but developed acute renal failure, aflutter w/ rvr, hypotension, and further volume od. neurology was consulted for prognosis and diagnosed anoxic brain injury with virtually no chance of full recovery. although brainstem reflexes were intact, he did not show any cortical function, and head ct/ eeg were consistent with anoxic brian injury. hd was performed in order to decrease toxins secondary to aki (bun > 100), but failed to improve neurologic status. family made the decision to withdraw care after it was discussed that there would be virtually no chance of neurologic recovery,

the holidays he ate much more salty food, and drank lots of alcohol.  stopped drinking on 1/5 and denies any withdrawal.  over the past few days noted that he was short of breath when lying down, dyspneic on exertion, some decreased appetite.  not much le edema.  also notes a chest tightness on the left side which is worst when lying down, better when sitting up.  not exacerbated by exertion.  no nausea/palpitations/diaphoresis.  does have l arm weakness when the pain starts.   patient was admitted with a normal bp but slight bump in troponin to 0.18.  no new ecg changes, just old septal infarct.  at the time his bp was reportedly normal, but on the floor his initial bp was in the 200\\'s-220\\'s.  he was given 10 iv hydral and this came down to the 170\\'s.  important to note that the patient denied any tearing chest pain or back pain, any changes in his vision, any confusion, or any headache.  his bp\\'s were not significantly different between either arm, and were actually slightly higher in the l arm.     hospital course by problem: hypertensive crisis:   patient was on coreg 12.5 and lisinopril 40 at home.  sbp\\'s on admission were into the 220\\'s on the floor.  due to med and diet non-compliance.  patient had a very similar hospitalization approximately 2 years ago.  he did have a troponin leak to 0.18 but on admission there were no ecg changes and his chest pain was atypical for acs with its worsening on rest and improvement on exertion, so this was presumed to be 2/2 his htn and not an acs event.  he had no neuro/visual changes to suggest stroke.  no renal damage.  no flash pulmonary edema on cxr.  equal bp\\'s in both arms and lack of tearing pain or widened mediastinum argue against dissection.  we did give him a dose of iv hydralazine which brought his bp\\'s down to the 170\\'s, and then restarted his home coreg, as well as hydralazine and isordil.  by discharge his bp\\'s were relatively well controlled on a regimen of coreg 25, isordil 40 tid, hydralazine 50 tid.  we held his lisinopril during active diuresis, and restarted lisinopril 10 on discharge as his ef < 40%.  troponinemia:   troponin trended out as 0.18 -> 0.18 -> 0.18 -> 0.19.  very atypical chest pain but he did develop new anterolateral t-wave inversions the night of 1/13.  with his significant risk factors (age, gender, smoking, plus trops and ecg changes) he was taken for lhc 1/14.  this cath showed clean coronaries and his trop leak was suspected 2/2 htn and chf.  we did medical management with asa 81 and bp control. acute on chronic systolic heart failure:   patient had pulmonary vascular congestion on cxr (though did not appear to be flash pulmonary edema).  bnp > 3000.  ef was 35-40% on tte in 1/2011.  repeat tte here was ef 30-35%.  etiology suspected htn and alcohol.  no known iscemia, and had normal pet in 2011.  trigger is med and diet non-compliance.  cr at or below baseline on admission.  he was given iv lasix 40 in the ed and responded well with 2 l net negative, and his symptoms resolved following this.  his cr did bump slightly with this diuresis, and he was getting a lhc, so we held his diuretics for several days until his cr trended back down.  on 1/16 his cr had trended down to 1.4, so we  started him on lasix 40 po daily, to be tritrated at his f/u appt in 1 week.   we also did coreg, hydral, isordil, and lisinopril as above.   spironolactone could be considered as an outpatient.  also could consider icd, though he may have improvement in his ef if he stops drinking.   we counseled him extensively about this. chronic kidney disease stage ii:   baseline cr 1.1-1.4.  cr 1.1 on admission.  bumped to 1.4 after diuresis and lhc dye, improved again to 1.3 by discharge. peripheral vascular disease, s/p fem-pop:   continued home asa 81.  stable.  le arterial doppler was done and showed moderate disease on r, minimal on l. hyperlipidemia:   ldl 112 in 9/2012.  not on statin at home.  started atorvastatin 40 (goal < 70 with pvd, a cad equivalent) history of bright red blood per rectum:   reported this several weeks ago, following diarrhea.  likely hemorrhoid/anal fissure.  normal colonoscopy within last 10 years per patient report.  h/h stable.   patient did not provide sample for fobt.  follow up as outpatient depression:   started prozac 20 nasal congestion:   started

disease, stage 3. history of present illness:         this is a 79-year-old nursing home patient who was sent to us for altered mental status.  chest x-ray showed pneumonia, and the patient had already been started on levaquin outpatient. unfortunately, her mental status worsened, and she was sent to the ed. hospital course by problem list: 1. influenza and pneumonia:  on admission, we placed her on tamiflu,     vancomycin, and zosyn.  her chest x-ray showed pneumonia in the right     middle lobe.  her respiratory viral panel showed she was positive for     influenza a.  she has completed tamiflu.  her antibiotics were changed      over to levaquin and she is completing a 10-day course.  we also placed her on     steroids for possible reactive airway disease.  she was having coarse     breath sounds and wheezing.  she required high-flow oxygen early in her     hospitalization.  we have been weaning that down, she is now requiring only     1 l, and they can continue to wean on discharge.  the steroids will also be     weaned outpatient. 2. delirium:  this was secondary to her infection and has resolved.  of note,     she had a ct scan done on admission that showed a left internal capsule     infarct, age indeterminate.  i discussed this with neurology, and given her     neurological exam, they doubt that this was acute.  the patient had also     been on anticoagulation.  given that her management would not really     change, we did not pursue further testing.  we are continuing to treat her     other risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes.  she does not have     hyperlipidemia, and so she was not placed on a statin. 3. type 2 diabetes:  prior to admission, she was diet controlled.  her blood     sugars were elevated here, secondary to the steroids, and we had to start     lantus and aspart insulin.  we will wean the lantus as the steroids are     weaned, and she will ultimately just be on a sliding scale. 4. acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease:  this resolved with iv     fluids early in hospitalization.  her baseline creatinine is about 1.3-1.6. 5. hypertension:  her blood pressure has been well controlled on her current     oral medications. 6. history of a deep venous thrombosis:  her inr was supratherapeutic on     admission and coumadin was held.  the inr worsened with antibiotics,      and she required 2 doses of vitamin k during hospitalization.  3     her inr is now subtherapeutic.  we have restarted her coumadin, and      she will need to be monitored to be sure her inr is at goal of between 2 and 3. 7. arrhythmias with a history of pacemaker:  she had some intermittent     ventricular tachycardia early in the hospitalization followed by some     frequent pvcs.  her pacer was interrogated, and minor adjustments were made.     she has not had further ectopy.  her tachycardia also improved when we change     her albuterol to xopenex.  we did an echo which showed a severely elevated     right ventricular systolic pressure.  we discussed the pulmonary hypertension     with her son.  the patient and the family decided that they do not want to     pursue a workup of this given the patient\\'s other comorbidities. 8. history of arthritis, schizophrenia and depression:  we continued her home     medications for this. disposition:                        the patient is returning to briarcliff

findings: the patient would not be a candidate for tavi due to the high placement of her bioprosthetic avr. a valve-in-valve tavi would put her at high risk for obstruction of her coronary arteries after placement of the percutaneous valve. .    problem and hospital course   problem #1:  severe bioprosthetic valve aortic stenosis.    hospital course:  the patient underwent placement of a bioprosthetic avr in 2009 at duke. she has had progressive worsening orthopnea, pnd, and chf symptoms requiring multiple hospitalizations over the past year. she was transferred from augusta for tavi eval. her admission tte showed an ef 20%, a mean gradient of 55 and ava 0.47, consistent with critical aortic valve stenosis. due to her multiple cormorbidities and poor functional status on admission, she was evaluated by the structural heart team for possible tavi. after a thorough diagnostic work-up and consultation with the partners trial team, she was deemed not a candidate because of the high placement of her current aortic valve, and the concern that a valve-in-valve approach might obstruct flow through her coronary arteries. she was then evaluated by dr. guyton, who agreed to do a high-risk surgical approach for re-do valve replacement. she will be transferred to euhm for surgery on 1/30/13.  .    problem #2:  acute on chronic decompensated systolic heart failure.    hospital course:  on admission, the patient was cold and wet on exam. she had an admission creatinine of 2.7, and had poor urine output to iv lasix. on hd 2, her bp dropped to 70s/40s after her 2nd dose of lasix despite poor urine output, so she was started on 5 mcg of dobutamine. her bp improved, and she began having robust uop to bid iv lasix 120 mg boluses. she was diuresed fropm 92-->84 kg. her dobutamine was weaned to 1.5 mcg to maintain euvolemia and renal perfusion. her diuretics had been held, however over the last few days they were reinitiated due to worsening volume status and hyponatremia. in addition, her dobutamine was increased to 2.5 mcg on 1/25 to augment her uop. she will need to be diuresed again prior to surgical intervention.  .    problem #3:  acute renal failure.    hospital course:  on admission, the patient\\'s cr was 2.7 likely due to poor cardiac output. after initiation of dobutamine and aggressive diuresis, her cr normalized. .    problem #4:  urinary tract infection.    hospital course:  on admission, the patient had a dirty u/a, and her family reported that she\\'d recently been treated for a uti. she was started on ceftriaxone, and competed a 7d course. .    problem #5:  rheumatoid arthritis.    hospital course:  the patient was recently diagnosed with ra by her outside providers, and was started on weekly methotrexate. the patient requested her methotrexate dose to be given in the hospital. 2d after her dose was given, she developed severe aphthous stomatitis. an hsv swab was negative. we attributed her  aphthous stomatitis to the methotrexate dose.  .    problem #6:  diabetes mellitus.    hospital course:  the patient was maintained on insulin with adequate glucose control. .    problem #7:  deconditioning.    hospital course:  the patient was evaluated by physical therapy, and will need further treatment. .   \"',\n",

vein was not visualized.  this patient had studies on several occasions, the last one on 12/17/2012 and all the examinations for deep vein thrombosis were negative.      hospital course   consults   consult: service: vascular surgery, findings: vascular surgery assessed patient\\'s left arm and indicated that it was actually significantly improved since the fistula in that arm had been ligated.  they felt tenderness could be due to general edema and throbosis w/in the ligated fistula.    consult: service: neprology, findings: dr. masud saw patient in the hospital.  nephrology recommended activated vitamin d supplementation for the patient\\'s calcium deficiency..    problem and hospital course   problem #1:  pulmonary edema and electolyte abnormalities 2/2 missed dialysis, in turn 2/2 lack of transport .    hospital course:  on admission, patient was sob and had pulmonary edema on cxr, and diffuse crackles on lung exam.  potassium was elevated to 6.0 without t wave changes.  patient received dialys sunday, monday, and tuesday, resulting in resolution of his signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema, as well as a return of his serum potassium to within lab normals.  patient was instructed to talked with his clinic social worker to arrange transport, which he did.  additionally, euhm social work informed us that the patient does in fact have medicaid and qualifies for transportation with southeast transportation.  this information was shared with the patient..    problem #2:  swelling f left arm and tenderness of wrist..    hospital course:  pt c/o swelling and tenderness of left arm and especially left wrist.  x-ray normal, dopplers normal.  arm assessed by vascular surgery and nephrology, who agreed that it appeared to be at its baseline chronic edema secondary to central stenosis from a previous fistula.  patient reported that the tenderness of the wrist had developed along with fevers and chills.  bcs drawn on admission and had no growth.  pt febile once after dialysis, but returned to normal temperature with a few hours without treatment.   measurement\\'s of the patient l arm at baseline were: 22cm circumference at wrist, 33cm circumference 5 cm distal to elbow, 38 cm circumference 10 cm proximal to elbow.  notably, the patient\\'s arm did become more swollen if he did not keep it elevated. overall, any acute component of his pain and swelling appeared to be secondary to increased edema in the setting of volume overload.  the patient was discharged with instructions to make an appointment with dr. mckinnon in vascular surgery if his edema did not improve in 1 month.  .    problem #3:  hiv/ aids, last cd4 count 94.    hospital course:  patient endorsed compliance with his home arv regimen.  this regimen was continued during the hospitalization.  no acute issues relating to the patient\\'s hiv occurred during hospitalization.  the patient was instructed to follow up with dr. lopez for further outpatient management..    problem #4:  2/2 hyperparathyroidism hypocalcemia.    hospital course:  patient\\'s calcium <7 on admission.  pth and vit d not at goal, were meassured last admission as being >1000 and 15 respectively.  as such, the patient was switched to calcium acetate for his phosphate binder, and initiated on calciriol 0.25 ug daily.  the patient\\'s calcium rose substatially to 7.7 by the

attending md:                        bryan j wells, m.d. chief complaint:                    weakness, leg swelling. final diagnoses:                    acute decompensated heart failure. reason for admission:               acute decompensated heart failure. past medical history: 1. heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction (ef:     50% to 55%). 2. obstructive sleep apnea, on cpap. 3. atrial fibrillation, on anticoagulation. 4. morbid obesity. 5. chronic lymphedema of lower extremities. 6. hypertension. 7. diabetes mellitus. 8. hyperthyroidism. 9. coronary artery disease. 10.hyperlipidemia. 11.uterine carcinoma, followed by oncology at piedmont hospital. 12.anxiety hospital course:                    the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history as above who presented to the emergency room with progressive worsening of lower extremity edema and orthopnea with early satiety.  patient reported decreased response to outpatient p.o. diuretics and was admitted for further management. 1. acute decompensated heart failure:  patient has history of heart failure     with preserved ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction (50% to 55%) who     was significantly volume overloaded on exam with lower extremity edema to     level of the sacrum.  etiology of decopensation was felt to be due to prn use of     torsemide as out-pt, with pt reporting once weekly use.  following admission,      the patient was, provided with aggressive iv diuresis, responding well      to metolazone 10 mg p.o. and furosemide 200 mg iv.  the patient was diuresed     approximately 11 kg with resolution of her symptoms.  the patient was      discharged at a weight of 154.6 kg and instructed to resume her outpatient      diuretic therapy. 2. atrial fibrillation:  patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with     rate controlled by beta-blocker and therapeutic inr.  patient was continued     on her home dose of warfarin and instructed to resume followup with her     outpatient anticoagulation clinic for further monitoring. 3. urinary tract infection:  during hospital stay, the patient required foley     catheter in the setting of aggressive diuresis and limited mobility.  the     patient was noted to have low-normal blood pressure and urine culture subsequently      collected revealed enterococcus faecalis, sensitive to nitrofurantoin.  the     patient remained afebrile and was started on therapy for her urinary tract     infection and instructed to continue her nitrofurantoin as outpatient to     complete a 10-day course of antibiotic therapy.  the patient was discharged     without a foley catheter. 4. deconditioning:  on admission, patient reported requiring maximal     assistance to transfer from bed to wheelchair over the preceding 12 to 18     months.  the patient noted chronic leg pain and swelling as etiology of     limited mobility.  the patient was aggressively diuresed with improvement     in her lower extremity swelling and started on gabapentin for neuropathic     leg pain.  physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted,     recommending subacute rehab versus home health with physical therapy.     patient continued to improve dramatically, able to transfer alone from bed     to chair with limited assistance from rolling walker.  patient was     discharged home with family with arrangements for home physical therapy to     continue reconditioning exercises. 5. anxiety:  on admission, patient\\'s confirmed home medications included     lorazepam 1 mg 3 times daily.  given high risk for falls in patient\\'s     deconditioned state, attempts to decrease benzodiazepine dose were     made with titration to lower dose and frequency.  at time of     discharge, patient was instructed to titrate down lorazepam 0.5 mg q.h.s.     as needed for anxiety with instructions to follow up with primary care     provider for additional management. 6. hypertension:  on admission, the patient\\'s blood pressure was well-     controlled on her outpatient regimen.  during hospital stay, patient     required additional rate controlling agents with increased dose of     metoprolol.  the patient was transitioned to metoprolol 150 mg xl to be     taken daily, providing patient with adequate blood pressure control. condition at discharge:             patient was discharged in fair condition to home with family. discharge instructions:              medications:  medications were reconciled in the electronic medical record  prior to hospital discharge. diet and activity:  patient was instructed to follow a low sodium, low-calorie ada diet with fluid restrictions to 2 liters daily. follow-up care instructions:  the patient was instructed to follow up with dr. divya gupta on 01/29/2013 at 2:15 p.m. for further management of her heart failure.  patient was instructed to follow up with her oncologist at piedmont hospital for further management of her endometrial cancer. jessie torgersen,

01/03/2013, shows a peak and mean gradient of    83 and 50 mmhg, calculated aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2.  lvot measures 20-    21 mm.  the patient has recently been hospitalized at gwinnett medical    center in 12/2012 with heart failure symptoms and is nyha class 3-4.. coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting x2,    once at age 54 and the 2nd at age 70, both for angina.  she does not have a    prior history of myocardial infarction.  left heart cath 01/24/2013,    showing a patent svg to mid lad, patent svg to mid om, patent svg to right    pda.. heart failure that is multifactorial.  she has a preserved ejection    fraction of 60%.  predominant etiology is likely valvular cardiomyopathy.    lvedp during left heart cath was 20 mmhg, nyha class 3-4, acc stage c.. severe peripheral vascular disease.  symptomatic claudication on the right.    the patient does not have transfemoral options for tavr.. hypertension for which the patient is currently on 2 antihypertensive    medications, and well controlled.. dyslipidemia for which the patient is on welchol.. history of 2:1 av block and history of atrial flutter that was ablated in    2006.  the patient was seen by the ep service on this admission.  pacemaker    is not indicated at this time, but there is a high likelihood that she    would need a permanent pacemaker post tavr implantation due to her    intermittent 2:1 conduction block. performed:. left heart cath and lower extremity angiography.. ct scan chest, abdomen and pelvis without contrast.. pfts.. transthoracic echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound duplex. course:                    the patient is a very pleasant 90-year-old female, who is a primary patient of dr. jerry lutz in the emory clinic. was seen by the structural cardiology team in clinic on 01/03/2013 for aortic stenosis.  due to symptoms and heart failure exacerbation, as as a recent hospitalization in 12/2012, she was admitted directly from for further evaluation, and tavr assessment.  she was diuresed initially iv diuretics, responded  well and was then transitioned to 20 mg p.o. of.  she also underwent tavr evaluation as listed above.  essentially, she not have transfemoral options.  she would be a 23 mm valve candidate, and on her inoperability/high risk, she would be a commercial implant.  her is 47% of predicted, and hence a transapical or transaortic option would not be ideal.  given that her carotid measures 7.8 mm at the junction with innominate, this would be our first access point of choice.  the patient lasix well and was negative approximately 3 l at the time of with improvement in her symptoms to class 3.  her son, paul, is very involved with her care.  the patient, as well the patient\\'s, had a detailed discussion with the structural cardiology team with regards moving forward.  they do understand the risks involved with a tavr, of 5% to 7% risk of major complications not limited to death, stroke, vascular complications, cardiac complications and the need for a pacemaker, as well as prolonged hospital stay.  they are willing to.  mr. paul mirpoorian was somewhat concerned about the delay between evaluation this admission and our next available date for a tavr implant, would be in the 1st week of february.  the structural cardiology team did mr. mirpoorian a balloon aortic valvuloplasty for his mother as a, to see if this would improve symptoms however he would prefer to the number of procedures and would like to wait until the tavr can be definitively and, hence, the 1st week of february is agreeable to.  should an earlier date be available, the structural team would be him at the earliest time.  on the day of discharge, the patient was with constant oxygen monitoring.  her baseline oxygen saturation was% without oxygen and at the end of approximately 50 feet, her oxygen dipped to 92%.  overall, per patient, as well as patient\\'s son, this to be an improvement as from the time of admission.  the remainder of her course was unremarkable.:                        the patient was discharged to home in a condition under the care of her son.:                           the patient will be contacted by the cardiology team for scheduling her tavr, which will be done as a commercial implant with a 23 mm edwards valve in the 1st week of, to be performed in or 13 at euh. medications:              her hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. 20 mg p.o. daily was initiated.  for the remainder, please refer to the medication reconciliation. kanitkar/vasilis
